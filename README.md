# Mirage Demo Project

This project is intended to be used as a visual aid for a presentation on how
[Mirage](https://miragejs.com/) can provide a better experience for building a
React/Client-side application where the end API might not be completed yet.
Static mock data can certainly work, but Mirage can provide a number of
improvements over simply static data fixtures or endpoint mocks.

**Note that the code showcased here should not be used for a real production app
and is intended to act as an introduction to Mirage.**
